Are you excited? Because I am excited. After over a decade working as a software engineer I've decided
to write a blog. This is truly a momentus day! As best as I can tell the importance of blogging can be 
expressed as follows.

{% highlight c# %}
if(!blogging){
    return me.Any(x=>x.hasALife);    
}
{% endhighlight %}
