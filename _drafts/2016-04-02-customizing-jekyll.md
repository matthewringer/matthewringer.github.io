Jekyll ships with it's own tiny webserver so you can get right to hacking on your new site. It also is configured to watch your file system and recompile when changes are detected. How cool is that?

That enough for now, crack a beer for a job well done. In our next post we'll cover Jekyll plugins for useful things like pagination, taming layouts with [Liquid][Liquid], Less and Bootstrap and getting our custom domain properly configured.
