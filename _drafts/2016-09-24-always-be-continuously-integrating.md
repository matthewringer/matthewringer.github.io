I've been an advocate of *Continuous integration* and *TDD* practices for more than a few years now. In the past it was often difficult to convince bosses and peers that it was worth the effort to configure and deploy. In every case the time spent was repaid exponentially in faster and smoother deployments, and fewer defects. 

Happily these days the setting up CI easier, the tools are better and there are lots of options. Introducing Travis CI. If you're using GitHub (changes are you are) and not taking advantage of Travis you are missing out. Travis is free to use if you have a public repo, and only a few clicks away from building your repository for every commit.
